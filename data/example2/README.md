### README.md for Example 2 CSVW Metadata

#### Overview
This README outlines the features of the CSVW metadata for the `example2` dataset. This dataset also includes a list of financial transactions, similar to `example1`, but with additional metadata descriptors.

#### Key Differences from Example 1

1. **Descriptive Metadata**:
   - **Title**: "Financial Transactions" - Provides a general title for the dataset.
   - **Description**: "A log of financial transactions carried out between CompanyA and CompanyB in 2023." - Offers a clear description of the dataset's content.
   - **Publisher**:
     - `schema:name`: "FinCorp Ltd." - Names the publisher of the dataset.
     - `schema:url`: Points to the publisher's URL.
   - **Keywords**: ["transactions", "financial"] - Lists keywords for categorizing or searching the dataset.
   - **License**: Specifies the dataset's license as Creative Commons Attribution (`cc-by`) via a URL.
   - **Modified Date**: Indicates the last modification date of the dataset (`2023-10-25`).

2. **Table Schema**:
   - Structurally similar to `example1`, including columns for `transaction_id`, `date`, `payer`, `payee`, `description`, and `amount`.
   - Each column has bilingual titles (English and French) and specified data types.
   - The `aboutUrl` is set to `"http://example.com/transactions/{transaction_id}"`, providing a unique URI for each transaction.

3. **Context Specification**:
   - Identical to `example1`, with the CSVW namespace and English as the default language.

#### Usage
- This metadata enriches the CSV data with additional context, making it more understandable and accessible.
- It can be utilized by data processing tools to generate RDF data, facilitate data mapping, or simply understand the dataset's structure and content.

#### Enhanced Metadata
- The addition of descriptive metadata like title, description, publisher information, keywords, licensing, and modification date makes this CSVW metadata more informative and useful for data cataloging and discovery.

#### Limitations
- Similar to `example1`, this metadata is specifically designed for the `transactions.csv` file structure and may require adjustment for other datasets.
