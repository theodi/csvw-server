### README.md for Example 4 CSVW Metadata

#### Overview
This README outlines the CSVW metadata for `example4`, a dataset representing financial transactions. While retaining the core structure of `example3`, `example4` introduces key refinements and additions in its metadata configuration, enhancing semantic richness and alignment with specific vocabularies.

#### Key Differences from Example 3

1. **Virtual Columns for Complex Structures**:
   - Introduction of multiple virtual columns to construct a `MonetaryAmount` object:
     - `amount` is marked with `"suppressOutput": true`, indicating that this column's data should not be directly included in the output.
     - A new virtual column for `schema:amount` creates a link to a detailed amount description.
     - Further virtual columns define a `MonetaryAmount` structure with `rdf:type`, `schema:value`, and `schema:currency` properties.
   - These virtual columns leverage the `aboutUrl` and `valueUrl` attributes to create more complex data structures than in `example3`.

2. **ValueUrls for `payee` and `payer`**:
  - `valueUrl` has been added to `payee` and `payer` meaning they are now references to objects, not just titles of companies

#### Usage
- `example4`'s metadata is particularly suitable for scenarios requiring high semantic fidelity and alignment with specific vocabularies, such as data integration, RDF conversion, or sophisticated data processing pipelines.
- The dataset is fully compatible with JSON-LD tools, allowing for effective validation, visualization, and interaction.

#### Limitations
- The added complexity in `example4`, particularly with custom namespaces and virtual columns, might necessitate advanced processing tools and an understanding of the specific vocabularies used.
