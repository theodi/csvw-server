### README.md for Example 4 CSVW Metadata

#### Overview
This README outlines the CSVW metadata for `example4`, a dataset representing financial transactions. While retaining the core structure of `example3`, `example4` introduces key refinements and additions in its metadata configuration, enhancing semantic richness and alignment with specific vocabularies.

#### Key Differences from Example 3

1. **Table Schema Refinements**:
   - **Property URLs**:
     - `example4` uses the `pay` namespace for `payer` and `payee` columns, resulting in `propertyUrl` values of `pay:payer` and `pay:payee`, aligning these columns with a specific payment vocabulary.
     - The `valueUrl` for `payer` and `payee` is updated to `company/{payer}` and `company/{payee}`, implying a more concise and meaningful reference.
   - **Virtual Column for Payment Type**:
     - A new virtual column is introduced: `"propertyUrl": "rdf:type", "valueUrl": "pay:Payment"`, which categorizes each transaction explicitly as a `Payment` type within the `pay` namespace.
   - **Suppress Output for Amount**:
     - Similar to `example3`, `amount` is marked with `"suppressOutput": true`, indicating that this column's data should not be directly included in the output.

2. **Semantic Enhancements**:
   - The use of the `pay` namespace for relevant columns and virtual columns enables a closer alignment with standardized payment vocabularies and terms, providing clearer semantics for the data.

3. **Virtual Columns Configuration**:
   - `example4` maintains the complex virtual column structure seen in `example3` for defining `MonetaryAmount`, enhancing the dataset's semantic representation with specific types and values.

#### Usage
- `example4`'s metadata is particularly suitable for scenarios requiring high semantic fidelity and alignment with specific vocabularies, such as data integration, RDF conversion, or sophisticated data processing pipelines.
- The dataset is fully compatible with JSON-LD tools, allowing for effective validation, visualization, and interaction.

#### Limitations
- The added complexity in `example4`, particularly with custom namespaces and virtual columns, might necessitate advanced processing tools and an understanding of the specific vocabularies used.
